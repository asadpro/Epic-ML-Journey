    "text": "Command Prompt (cmd) for short.\nPowerShell\nIDLE Python shell\nOpen your favorite Editor and write the following code into it and then save it as hello.py (python programs can be run only if they are in .py extension)\n\n\n\n1print(\"Yay! i am writing my first program\")\n2print('i am printing')\n3('' , \"\")\n\n1\n\nprint is called a function which will be explained in the letter chapters. so don’t stuck on this programming lingo for now.\n\n2\n\nAs you can see between those yellow brackets, text can be enclosed in both single and double quotes.\n\n3\n\nThese quotes tell Python that we are writing strings and strings are like plain text to Python, it’s that simple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlso, run your code in Python Visual Compiler which explains and runs your code step by step to show you what happens under the hood. Here’s the link: Python Visual Compiler\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Comments in Python\nComments are used to tell what the specific part of your program does and it’s like an instruction box for your line of code. It can also be used to disable your code. so this it won’t run.\n\n1print('printing nothing') #single line comment\n\n2'''Multiline comments'''\n\n1\n\nThis is a single line of comment. Here with pound character, I can write anything just to explain this piece of code not to execute it\n\n2\n\nYou can also use multiline comments with the help of 3 single quotes which are used to write multiple lines without specifying any # hash or pound character every time you start a new line of text.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Numbers & Math in Python\n\nMost Commonly used Mathematics symbols\n\n\nSymbols\nNames\n\n\n\n\n+\nPlus\n\n\n-\nMinus\n\n\n/\nSlash\n\n\n*\nAsterisk\n\n\n%\nPercent\n\n\n&lt;\nLess-than\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater-than\n\n\n&lt;=\nLess-than-equal\n\n\n&gt;=\nGreater-than-equal\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Variable & Names\nFirst, let’s understand Variable in simple terms:\nImagine you have a box, and you give it a name, like number_box Now, you can put a number in it, let’s say 5. So, number_box holds the value 5.\nnumber_box = 5\nHere number_box is the variable and the number 5 is the value in it. You can also change it like below\nnumber_box = 10\nprint(number_box) # Output: 10\nNow it contains 10 instead of 5. Variables are useful and it lets you store and keep track of your numbers text and several other things you will see in the advanced sections.\nQuiz time:\n\nQuestion 1: Write a Python code snippet to print the phrase “Hello, Python!”\n\n\nQuestion 2: How can you print the result of multiplying two numbers, let’s say 4 and 7, in Python?\n\n\nQuestion 3: Explain what the end parameter in the print function is used for.\n\n\nQuestion 4: Write a Python code snippet to print your name on one line and your age on the next line.\n\n\nQuestion 5: If you want to print the following text on separate lines:\n\nProgramming\nis\nfun!\nHow would you achieve this using the print function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see answers…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(\"Hello, Python!\")\nprint(4 * 7)\nThe end parameter in the print function is used to specify the character that separates multiple printed items. By default, it is set to \\n, which means a newline character. Newline is like when we reach the end of a line we press enter that’s exactly what do, just to press enter at the end of a line.\nprint(\"Your Name\")\nprint(\"Your Age\")\nprint(\"Programming\")\nprint(\"is\")\nprint(\"fun!\")\n\n\n\n\nString formating\nWe can also format our string output in different ways, First I will write code and then from following you can see its explanation below:\n\nmy_name = 'Asad Pro Beta' # My digital persona \naddress = 'Peshawar, Pakistan'\nmy_age = 35 # Just kidding\nmy_height = 74 # inches\n\n1print(my_name+' ',address)\n2print(my_name+3*'.')\n3print('Your name is: {} my age: {}'.format(my_name,my_age))\n4print('Your age is: {1} my name: {0}'.format(my_name, my_age))\n5print(f'Your name is: {my_name} my age: {my_age}')\n6print(r'Your name is: {my_name} my age: {my_age}')\n\n1\n\nThis + sign merges (concatenates) two strings together and that white space separates them\n\n2\n\nFirst multiply the dot with 3 which becomes (…) & then concatenate (merge) it with that string (my_name)\n\n3\n\nThe format function in Python is like a template for creating sentences where you want to replace certain parts with specific values. Let me explain with an analogy: Imagine you have a fill-in-the-blank storybook. The storybook has sentences with blanks, and you have stickers with words on them. Each sticker has a different word that fits into one of the blanks.\n\n4\n\nWe can also use index numbers, Index are like the address of every variable where stored on computer memory.\n\n5\n\nPutting f in the beginning acts as a format function with which it identifies variables.\n\n6\n\nPutting r in the beginning means that this string is raw which means nothing in other words, print everything as it is.\n\n\n\n1A,B,C,D,E = [i for i in range(ord('A'),ord('E')+1)]\na,b,c,d,e = [i for i in range(ord('a'),ord('e')+1)]\n\n\n2print(A,B,C,D,E,\n      a,b,c,d,e)\n\n3A, B, C, D, E = [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]\n\ndays = \"Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun\"\n4months = \"Jan\\nFeb\\nMar\\nApr\\nMay\\nJun\\nJul\\nAug\"\n\nprint(days)\nprint(months) \n\n1\n\nThis is another way to assign a list of values to multiple variables at once. (Don’t bother we will cover Lists in later chapters)\n\n2\n\nRemove that comma after ‘E’ and see what happens\n\n3\n\nIt’s the same as the first one above, I have just created the list dynamically in the first place.\n\n4\n\nHere you will see that the \\n character will act as an enter and printing will start from the new line. Copy and paste it into your editor and see its result on your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to explore print function thoroughly\n\n\n\nMore on print\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Escape Sequences\nImagine you’re writing a story on the computer, and you want to do some special things with your words. Escape sequences in Python are like magic codes you can use to make your words look different or do special tricks!\nLook at the following table and try them out on your own:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEscape\nWhat it does\n\n\n\n\n\\\\\nBackslash ()\n\n\n\\'\nSingle-quote (’)\n\n\n\\\"\nDouble-quote (“)\n\n\n\\a\nASCII bell (BEL)\n\n\n\\b\nASCII backspace (BS)\n\n\n\\f\nASCII formfeed (FF)\n\n\n\\n\nASCII linefeed (LF)\n\n\n\\N{name}\nCharacter named name in the Unicode database\n\n\n\\r\nASCII carriage return (CR)\n\n\n\\t\nASCII horizontal tab (TAB)\n\n\n\\uxxxx\nCharacter with 16-bit hex value xxxx (Unicode only)\n\n\n\\Uxxxxxxxx\nCharacter with 32-bit hex value xxxxxxxx (Unicode only)\n\n\n\\v\nASCII vertical tab (VT)\n\n\n\\ooo\nCharacter with octal value oo\n\n\n\\xhh\nCharacter with hex value hh\n\n\n\nPrompting People or Asking for Input\nprint('How old are you?') \nage =  input()\nprint(f'Your age : {age}')\ninput() is a method that shows you an empty placeholder for you to insert any value & when you insert then press enter so that the value can be stored in the age variable.\n\nInput() function is like an empty page; someone gives you and you write anything that comes to your mind.\n\n\nHere, we have used the same string formatting as we used earlier.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Python modules\nLet’s see the code first…\n1import os\n2current_path = os.getcwd()\nprint(current_path)\n\n1\n\nos is a built-in module of Python that is used to do local operating system level operations like directory change, the path of the folder navigating through directories etc.\n\n2\n\nThis code just copies the path where you are running your file. Don’t confuse yourself with that os.getcwd() for now you will soon understand this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModule in simple terms\n\n\n\nThink of these modules OS this way. If Python is an electrician then modules are its tool sets with every tool having its specific purpose (pliers, voltage tester, wire stripper, multimeter etc) or you can say these modules are the features of Python.\n\n\nAsking Prompt and Passing Argument\nfrom sys import argv\nscript_name, username = argv\nprint(f'Script name: {script_name}')\nprint(f'Username: {username}')\n\n'''\nInput:   python delete.py asad\nOutput:  Script name: delete.py\n         Username: Asad\n'''\n\nThis is the other way to import a module(feature) which says import from the module sys the argv method (which is a small part of that module)\nFirst open the terminal and navigate to your file where it is stored then run python delete.py asad here delete.py is my python file name write what’s yours and asad is the argument like an extra input to catch it inside our program.",

It continues executing the code as long as the specified condition remains true.\nHere’s a simple explanation and example in Python:\nExplanation:\nA while loop checks a condition before each iteration. If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed. After each iteration, the condition is checked again. The loop continues until the condition becomes false.\n# Initialize a variable\ncounter = 1\n\n# Define the condition\nwhile counter &lt;= 5:\n    # Code inside the loop\n    print(counter) # \n    \n    # Update the counter for the next iteration\n    counter += 1\nExplanation of the Example:\n\nWe start with the counter set to 1.\nThe condition counter &lt;= 5 is true, so we enter the loop and print the value of the counter.\nWe increment the counter by 1 (using counter += 1) to move to the next number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhile loop may also crash your program while giving it such a condition which never meant to end like the one below:\nwhile True:\n   print('This loop will never end.')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrapped in an infinite loop\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you ever find yourself trapped in the infinite loop then simply press CTRL+CCTRL+C.

A for loop is like flipping through each book one by one and checking the pages. You keep doing this until you’ve looked through all the books in your backpack.\n# Imagine your backpack is like a list of books\nbackpack = [\"Adventure Book\", \"Science Book\", \"Mystery Book\", \"Comic Book\"]\n\n# Using a for loop to check each book\nfor book in a backpack:\n    # Code inside the loop\n    print(\"Checking the pages of\", book)\n\n# After the loop, you've checked every book in your backpack!\nIn this example:\n\nbackpack is like your list of books.\nThe for loop is like going through each book (Adventure Book, Science Book, etc.) in your backpack, one after the other.\nThe code inside the loop (printing “Checking the pages of [book]”) is like looking through the pages of each book.\nAfter the loop, you’ve checked every book in your backpack.\n\n\n2.10.1 Range() function\nThe range function is used to specify the number of iterations dynamically to the loop so it won’t go beyond that limit e.g. Let’s stick to the previous example:\nbackpack = [\"Adventure Book\", \"Science Book\", \"Mystery Book\", \"Comic Book\"]\n\n1for i in range(len(backpack))\n2   print(backpack[i])\n\n1\n\nThe len() function returns the number of elements in the list which is 5, so it would start from 0 and go to the length of that list (5).\n\n2\n\nHere, in the first iteration i would be 0 so it will fetch the first element of the list.\n\n\nDon’t worry, We will see the lists in detail later.\n\n\n2.10.2 Start, Stop & Step Arguments to range()\nWe can also pass arguments to the functions & arguments are like giving superpower to that function. Look it in practice:\n1for i in range(1, 10, 2): # (start, stop, step)\n   print(i)\n   Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\n\n1\n\nThis says, Start from 1 and go till 10 but skip 2 digits between and print the third digit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also use a negative number in the step argument to make the for go from up to down.\nfor i in range(0, -10, -1): \n   print(i)",

    "text": "4.6 Working with Lists\nWhen you first begin writing programs it’s tedious to create many variables of the same type. For example to store my car collection:\n\n# Long way to store multiple values in different variable names\nCertainly! Here are nine different car model names:\n\ncar1 = \"Toyota Camry\"\ncar2 = \"Ford Mustang\"\ncar3 = \"Honda Civic\"\ncar4 = \"BMW 3 Series\"\ncar5 = \"Chevrolet Corvette\"\ncar6 = \"Mercedes-Benz E-Class\"\ncar7 = \"Volkswagen Golf\"\ncar8 = \"Tesla Model S\"\ncar9 = \"Nissan Rogue\"\nThis turns out that this is a bad way to write code. (I also don’t own these cars, I swear, I just copied these names from the Internet)\nInstead of using multiple repetitive variables, you can use a single variable that has list of values. For example, here’s a new and improved version of the above source code.\ncars_collection = []\nwhile True:\n    print('Enter the name of Car or Leave it empty to Quit:')\n    name = input()\n    if name == \"\":\n        break\n    else:\n        # list Concatenation \n        cars_collection = cars_collection + [name] \nprint('Collection: ',cars_collection)",

For example, my_string[0] or my_list[0] refers to the first element.\n\nSlicing:\n\nBoth support slicing to extract a portion of the sequence. For instance, my_string[1:4] or my_list[1:4] extracts elements from index 1 to 3.\n\nIterability:\n\nBoth can be iterated using loops. You can use a for loop to go through each character in a string or each element in a list.\n\nConcatenation:\n\nYou can concatenate strings using the + operator, and you can concatenate lists using the + operator as well.\n\nInclusion:\n\nBoth can use the in operator to check if a specific element is present in the sequence.\n\n\nHere’s a quick example showcasing these similarities:\n# Strings\nmy_string = \"Hello, World!\"\nprint(my_string[0])        # Output: H\nprint(my_string[7:12])     # Output: World\nprint('W' in my_string)    # Output: True\n\n# Lists\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(my_list[2])          # Output: 3\nprint(my_list[1:4])        # Output: [2, 3, 4]\nprint(3 in my_list)        # Output: True\nDespite these similarities, it’s crucial to note that strings are immutable (you can’t change individual characters once the string is created), while lists are mutable (you can modify, add, or remove elements).",

For example, when you do x = 10, x is a reference to the memory location where the value 10 is stored. Let’s look at the following code block:\n# Creating references\na = 5  # 'a' is a reference to the value 5\nb = [1, 2, 3]  # 'b' is a reference to a list [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Modifying through references\na = a + 1  # Creates a new object (6) and updates 'a' to reference it\nb.append(4)  # Modifies the list object directly\n\n# Passing references to a function\ndef modify_list(lst):\n    lst.append(5)\n\nmodify_list(b)  # 'b' is passed by reference, and the list is modified\n\n# Changing reference\nc = b  # 'c' now references the same list as 'b'\nIn simple words, reference means when you create variable var1 = data variable (var1) point to the address of value data on computer memory. For example in the following code you can find the address of a variable using id() function.\n\n# Creating different names variable with same value\n1var1 = 'data'\nvar2 = 'data'\nvar3 = 'data'\n\n# Find memory address using id() method\nprint(id(var1))\nprint(id(var2))\nprint(id(var3))\n\n# Create variable with different value \n2var4 = 'data1'\nvar5 = 'data2'\n\nprint(id(var4))\nprint(id(var5))\n\n1\n\nAs you can see these three variable have same value so their value won’t create separate memory address rather all of them will point to the same memory address.\n\n2\n\nvar4 & var5 have different values so each variable will create their own memory address.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Reference\n\n\ncomputers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nlaptop = computers\nmobile = computers\n\n\n# Below all will return the same memory address because all of the variable have same value. So, all of them would point to the memory address of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] instead of creating identical copy of it.\n\nprint(f'Address 1: {id(computers)}\\nAddress 2: {id(laptop)}\\nAddress 3: {id(mobile)}')\nDifferent Variable of Same Value You can create two lists with the same values using different variables. Here’s an example:\n# Creating two lists with the same values\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Checking if they have the same values\nprint(\"Are the lists equal?\", list1 == list2)\n\n# Checking if they are different objects (different variables)\nprint(\"Are the variables different?\", list1 is not list2)\n\n# Checking memory address of both\nprint(id(list1),id(list2))\nprint(id(list1) == id(list2))\nIn this example, list1 and list2 have the same values, but they are different objects with different memory addresses. The == operator checks for equality of values, and the is operator checks if they refer to the same object in memory.",

The difference becomes apparent when the original list is modified. The shallow copy retains references to the nested lists, so changes inside the nested lists are reflected in both the original and shallow copy. The deep copy, on the other hand, creates entirely new objects for the nested lists, making it independent of changes in the original.",

    "text": "5.2 The keys(), values(), items() & get() methods\n\nThe keys() method returns the keys of a dictionary in a list-like format but not exactly a list. For Example:\n    my_dict = {\n    'apple': 5,\n    'banana': 8,\n    'orange': 12,\n    'grape': 20,\n    'kiwi': 3\n}\n\nfor key in my_dict.keys():\n    print(key)\nThe values() method returns values of the dictionary in list-like format. For Example:\n    my_dict = {\n    'apple': 5,\n    'banana': 8,\n    'orange': 12,\n    'grape': 20,\n    'kiwi': 3\n}\n\nfor value in my_dict.values():\n    print(value)\nThe items() method returns both keys and values separately. For Example: ```python my_dict = { ‘apple’: 5, ‘banana’: 8, ‘orange’: 12, ‘grape’: 20, ‘kiwi’: 3 }\n for key, value in my_dict.items():\n     print(key,' : ', value)\n\n print(type(my_dict.values()))\nget() Sometimes we want to return the value of a key in a dictionary but what if the key doesn’t exist then it would give you a tedious and ugly error message. Fortunately, to prevent such error messages python has the get() method on dictionary that returns None by default else returns the user-defined value. For Example:\n my_dict = {\n     'name': 'Asad',\n     'age': 22,\n     'city': 'Peshawar',\n     'occupation': 'Student',\n     'interest': 'Machine Learning'\n }\n\n # Using get() to retrieve values\n name_value = my_dict.get('name')\n\n # If gender key isn't in `my_dict` dictionary then it would return `Not specified`\n gender_value = my_dict.get('gender', 'Not specified')\n\n print(name_value)      # Output: 'Asad'\n print(gender_value)    # Output: 'Not specified' (since the 'gender' key is not present)\nIf you run print(type(my_dict.values())) this will return a view of the values in a dictionary which if I explain simply to an 8 grader child then ‘view of the values’ would be like a mirror which facing the current dictionary within which we can see all the values inside of that dictionary but if we change the values inside dictionary this affect the view of the values also.",

The output will be:\nSplitted words: ['Hello', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'I', 'hope', 'everything', 'is', 'fine', '']\nThe resulting list contains individual words from the original string, excluding spaces and punctuation.",

    "text": "8.12 The character classes metacharacter:\nCharacter classes in regular expressions allow you to specify a set of characters that you want to match at a particular position in the pattern. They are defined using square brackets ([]) and provide a concise way to express a group of characters.\nHere is a list of different character classes:\n\n\\d: Matches any digit (equivalent to [0-9]).\n\\D: Matches any non-digit character (equivalent to [^0-9]).\n\\w: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore, equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_]).\n\\W: Matches any non-word character (equivalent to [^A-Za-z0-9_]).\n\\s: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and newlines).\n\\S: Matches any non-whitespace character.\n[a-zA-Z]: Matches any uppercase or lowercase letter.\n[^abc]: Matches any character except ‘a’, ‘b’, or ‘c’.\n\n\nExamples of Character Classes:\n\nMatching Digits:\n\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"The price is $25.99.\"\n\n# Pattern with a character class to match any digit (0-9)\npattern = r'\\d'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: ['2', '5', '9', '9']\nIn this example, the pattern \\d is a shorthand for the character class [0-9] and matches any digit.\n\nMatching Alphanumeric Characters:\n\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"The account ID is A1234B.\"\n\n# Pattern with a character class to match alphanumeric characters\npattern = r'[A-Za-z0-9]'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: ['T', 'h', 'e', 'a', 'c', 'c', 'o', 'u', 'n', 't', 'I', 'D', 'i', 's', 'A', '1', '2', '3', '4', 'B']\nHere, the pattern [A-Za-z0-9] matches any uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit.\n\nMatching Whitespace Characters:\n\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"This is a sentence with some spaces.\"\n\n# Pattern with a character class to match whitespace characters\npattern = r'\\s'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']\nIn this example, the pattern \\s matches any whitespace character (spaces).\nCharacter classes are versatile and allow you to specify groups of characters that you want to match at a specific position in your regular expression pattern.",

Here’s an example:\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"John's age is 25, and Jane's age is 30.\"\n\n# Pattern with named capturing groups for names and ages\npattern = r\"(?P&lt;name&gt;\\w+)'s age is (?P&lt;age&gt;\\d+)\"\n\n# Using re.search() to find the first match\nmatch = re.search(pattern, text)\n\n# Accessing named groups using groupdict()\nif match:\n    group_dict = match.groupdict()\n    print(\"Matched Groups:\", group_dict)\n    print(\"Name:\", group_dict[\"name\"])\n    print(\"Age:\", group_dict[\"age\"])\nelse:\n    print(\"No match\")\nIn this example:\n\n(?P&lt;name&gt;\\w+): Defines a named capturing group named “name” to capture the person’s name.\n(?P&lt;age&gt;\\d+): Defines a named capturing group named “age” to capture the person’s age.\n\nThe groupdict() method is then used to retrieve a dictionary containing the named groups and their corresponding matched values.\nOutput:\nMatched Groups: {'name': 'John', 'age': '25'}\nName: John\nAge: 25\n\n\n9.2.2 Using Named Groups in Regular Expressions:\nYou can also use named groups directly within the regular expression for referencing later. Here’s an example:\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"John's age is 25, and Jane's age is 30.\"\n\n# Pattern with named capturing groups used in the pattern\npattern = r\"(?P&lt;name&gt;\\w+)'s age is (?P&lt;age&gt;\\d+)\"\n\n# Using re.findall() to find all matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: [('John', '25'), ('Jane', '30')]\nIn this example, the re.findall() method returns a list of tuples, each containing the matched values for the named groups.\nNamed groups provide a clearer and more maintainable way to extract specific information from matched patterns in regular expressions. They are especially useful when dealing with complex patterns where multiple groups are involved.",

    "text": "9.3 Positive and negative lookahead\nPositive lookahead and negative lookahead are assertions in regular expressions that allow you to assert whether a certain pattern is present or not, without consuming characters in the process. These are non-capturing groups that enforce conditions on the text around the main pattern.\n\nPositive Lookahead:\nPositive lookahead is expressed as (?=...). It asserts that a certain pattern must be present at a particular position in the text.\n\n9.3.0.1 Example:\nLet’s say you want to match words that are followed by the word “apple”:\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"banana apple orange apple\"\n\n# Pattern using positive lookahead to match words before \"apple\"\npattern = r'\\b\\w+(?=\\sapple)'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: ['banana', 'orange']\nIn this example, the pattern \\b\\w+(?=\\sapple) matches words (\\b\\w+) only if they are followed by a space and the word “apple” ((?=\\sapple)). The positive lookahead ensures that “apple” is present after the matched words.\n\n\n\nNegative Lookahead:\nNegative lookahead is expressed as (?!...). It asserts that a certain pattern must not be present at a particular position in the text.\n\n9.3.0.2 Example:\nLet’s say you want to match words that are not followed by the word “apple”:\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"banana orange apple\"\n\n# Pattern using negative lookahead to match words not followed by \"apple\"\npattern = r'\\b\\w+\\b(?!.*\\sapple)'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: ['apple']\nIn this example, the pattern \\b\\w+\\b(?!.*\\sapple) matches words (\\b\\w+\\b) only if they are not followed by any sequence ((?!.*\\sapple)) that includes space and the word “apple”. The negative lookahead ensures that “apple” is not present after the matched words.\nLookahead assertions are powerful tools for creating flexible and precise regular expressions by specifying conditions in the context surrounding the main pattern.\nPositive lookbehind and negative lookbehind assertions in regular expressions are used to assert whether a certain pattern is present or not immediately before the main pattern, without consuming characters in the process.\n\n\n\nPositive Lookbehind:\nPositive lookbehind is expressed as (?&lt;=...). It asserts that a certain pattern must be present immediately before the main pattern.\n\n9.3.0.3 Example:\nLet’s say you want to match words that are preceded by the word “apple”:\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"apple banana apple orange\"\n\n# Pattern using positive lookbehind to match words after \"apple\"\npattern = r'(?&lt;=\\sapple\\s)\\w+'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: ['banana', 'orange']\nIn this example, the pattern (?&lt;=\\sapple\\s)\\w+ matches words (\\w+) only if they are preceded by a space and the word “apple” ((?&lt;=\\sapple\\s)). The positive lookbehind ensures that “apple” is present immediately before the matched words.\n\n\n\nNegative Lookbehind:\nNegative lookbehind is expressed as (?&lt;!...). It asserts that a certain pattern must not be present immediately before the main pattern.\n\n9.3.0.4 Example:\nLet’s say you want to match words that are not preceded by the word “apple”:\nimport re\n\n# Example text\ntext = \"banana orange apple\"\n\n# Pattern using negative lookbehind to match words not preceded by \"apple\"\npattern = r'(?&lt;!\\sapple\\s)\\w+'\n\n# Using re.findall() to find matches\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, text)\n\n# Displaying the matches\nprint(\"Matches:\", matches)\nOutput:\nMatches: ['banana', 'orange']\nIn this example, the pattern (?&lt;!\\sapple\\s)\\w+ matches words (\\w+) only if they are not preceded by a space and the word “apple” ((?&lt;!\\sapple\\s)). The negative lookbehind ensures that “apple” is not present immediately before the matched words.\nLookbehind assertions are useful for creating regular expressions that depend on the presence or absence of specific patterns before the main pattern. They provide additional flexibility in crafting precise matching conditions.\nDifference between Lookahead and Lookbehind:\n\nDirection:\n\nLookahead ((?=...) and (?!...)): Looks forward in the text.\nLookbehind (?&lt;=...) and (?&lt;!...): Looks backward in the text.\n\nPosition:\n\nLookahead: Asserts a condition on what comes after the main pattern.\nLookbehind: Asserts a condition on what comes before the main pattern.\n\n\nAnalogy for the Difference:\nConsider you’re exploring a new city. In lookahead, you decide whether to visit a place based on what you’ll find after reaching there – checking for upcoming attractions. In lookbehind, you decide whether to visit a place based on what you have encountered before – checking for previous positive or negative experiences.\nSummary:\n\nLookahead: Anticipates what comes after the main pattern.\n\nPositive Lookahead ((?=...)): Ensures the presence of a condition.\nNegative Lookahead (?!...): Ensures the absence of a condition.\n\nLookbehind: Reflects on what comes before the main pattern.\n\nPositive Lookbehind (?&lt;=...): Ensures the presence of a condition.\nNegative Lookbehind (?&lt;!...): Ensures the absence of a condition.\n\n\nLet’s have practice examples for each: positive lookahead, negative lookahead, positive lookbehind, and negative lookbehind.\n\n\n\n9.3.1 Positive Lookahead Practice Example:\nQuestion: Match words that are followed by the letter ‘s’.\nConsider the following words:\ncats\ndogs\nhorses\nbirds\nWrite a regular expression pattern using positive lookahead to match only the words that are followed by the letter ‘s’.\nExpected Output:\n['cat', 'dog', 'hors']\n\n\n9.3.2 Negative Lookahead Practice Example:\nQuestion: Match words that are not followed by the letter ‘s’.\nConsider the following words:\ncats\ndogs\nhorses\nbirds\nWrite a regular expression pattern using negative lookahead to match only the words that are not followed by the letter ‘s’.\nExpected Output:\n['bird']\n\n\n9.3.3 Positive Lookbehind Practice Example:\nQuestion: Match words that are preceded by the letter ‘t’.\nConsider the following words:\ntable\nchair\ndesk\nlamp\nWrite a regular expression pattern using a positive lookbehind to match only the words that are preceded by the letter ‘t’.\nExpected Output:\n['table', 'desk']\n\n\n9.3.4 Negative Lookbehind Practice Example:\nQuestion: Match words that are not preceded by the letter ‘t’.\nConsider the following words:\ntable\nchair\ndesk\nlamp\nWrite a regular expression pattern using negative lookbehind to match only the words that are not preceded by the letter ‘t’.\nExpected Output:\n['chair', 'lamp']",

    "text": "10.7 Project Email & Phone Number Extraction:\n\nOverview:\nThis project involves extracting phone numbers and email addresses from a text source, cleaning up the data, and storing it in a tabular format in both an Excel file (.xlsx) and a text file (.txt). The extracted information is then added to a dictionary, where phone numbers are used as keys and email addresses as values. Carriage return characters ( are removed from the keys in the dictionary to ensure clean data. The final step involves saving the processed data to both an Excel file and a text file for easy reference.\n\n\nSteps:\n\nCopy the content of the ‘phonebook.txt’ file to the clipboard.\nUse regular expressions to find and extract phone numbers and email addresses from the clipboard content.\nOrganize the extracted data into a dictionary, where phone numbers are keys and email addresses are values.\nClean up the dictionary by removing carriage return characters from the keys.\nCreate an Excel workbook and sheet, inserting the phone numbers into one column and email addresses into another.\nSave the Excel workbook as ‘phoneEmail.xlsx’.\nCreate a PrettyTable to display the data in a tabular format.\nWrite the tabular data to a text file named ‘phoneEmail.txt’.\nOptionally, use Pyperclip to copy the cleaned dictionary to the clipboard for easy access.\n\n\n\nTips:\n\nEnsure that the ‘pyperclip’, ‘openpyxl’, and ‘prettytable’ modules are installed before running the script.\nVerify that the ‘phonebook.txt’ file contains the expected data and is accessible.\nReview the generated ‘phoneEmail.xlsx’ Excel file and ‘phoneEmail.txt’ text file to confirm the output.\nExperiment with the code and modify it based on specific project requirements or preferences.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently extract, clean, and organize phone numbers and email addresses from a text source, storing the information in both Excel and text files for convenient reference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey note before implementing the project\n\n\n\nFirst you have to copy the content or text from the link phonebook to the clipboard and it has to be on the clipboard all the time in order for this project to work\n\n\nDownload phonebook.txt text file to use it in the upcoming practice session:\nCondition 1: Get the text off the clipboard. Condition 2. Find all phone numbers and email addresses in the text. Condition 3. Paste them onto the clipboard.\nimport re\nimport pyperclip\n\n# Click on the above link and copy the content of phonebook.txt to the clipboard.\n# Step 1: Get the text off the clipboard.\ncontent = pyperclip.paste()\n\n\n# Step 2: Find all phone numbers and email addresses in the text.\n\n# Create a regex for email address\nemail_regex = r\"(?:Email: )(.*@.+\\.\\w{2,3})\"\n\n# Create a regex for phone number\nphone_regex = r'(?:Phone: )(.*)'\n\n# Search for phone number in string\nresult1 = re.findall(phone_regex, content)\n\n# Search for email address in string\nresult2 = re.findall(email_regex, content)\n\n# Encapsulated both in a dictionary\nd = dict(zip(result1,result2))\n\n# removing the carriage return character (\\r) from every key in the dictionary to cleanup the dictionary\nclean_d = {key.rstrip() : value for key, value in d.items()}\n\n# Iterating through the key value pair of dictionary \n# for key, value in clean_d.items():\n#     print(key, \" : \", value)\n    \n# Further expanding this project by adding the above content to the excel sheet or text file (in tabular format)\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Adding the above dictionary to text file in tabular format\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\n\n# Create workbook/spreadsheet\nworkbook = Workbook()\n\n# Focusing the current opening sheet\nsheet = workbook.active\n\n# Inserting the phone number in one column and email addresses to another column\n# The following code is explained briefly later on.\nfor index, value in enumerate(clean_d.items(),start=1):\n    sheet[f'A{index}'] = value[0]\n    sheet[f'B{index}'] = value[1]\n    \n\n# Saving the excel file\nworkbook.save('phoneEmail.xlsx')\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Now adding the above content to a text file in tabular format\nfrom prettytable import PrettyTable\ntable = PrettyTable(['Phone Number','Email Address'])\nfor key, value in clean_d.items():\n    table.add_row([key, value])\n\nwith open('phoneEmail.txt', 'w') as file:\n    file.write(str(table))\n\n# ------------------------------------------------------------\n# Step 3: Paste them onto the clipboard.\n# pyperclip.copy(str(clean_d))\nExplanation to the above snippet code:\nfor index, value in enumerate(clean_d.items(),start=1):\n    sheet[f'A{index}'] = value[0]\n    sheet[f'B{index}'] = value[1]\nLet’s break down the code step by step:\n\nenumerate(cleaned_dict.items(), start=1): This function is used to iterate over the items of the cleaned_dict dictionary, and it returns pairs of the form (index, (key, value)). The start=1 argument specifies that the enumeration should start from index 1.\nfor i, (key, value) in ...: This is a loop that iterates through the enumerated items. i is the index, and (key, value) is the key-value pair.\nsheet[f'A{i}'] = key: This line assigns the key to the cell in column ‘A’ and row i of the Excel sheet. The f-string is used for string formatting to include the value of i in the cell reference.\nsheet[f'B{i}'] = value: Similarly, this line assigns the value to the cell in column ‘B’ and row i of the Excel sheet.\nThe loop continues for each key-value pair in the cleaned_dict, and the corresponding values are added to the ‘A’ and ‘B’ columns in the Excel sheet.\n\nIn summary, the code iterates through the key-value pairs of the dictionary, assigns each key to column ‘A’ and each value to column ‘B’ in the Excel sheet, and increments the row index (i) for each iteration. This way, each key-value pair gets its own row in the Excel sheet.",

So, any month from 01 to 12 is valid; any day from 01 to 31 is valid; and any year from prior to 2002 is valid. Therefore, to specify any of these ranges, you will need to use character classes and OR operations, using the pipe metacharacter. Don’t forget about the forward slashes separating the month, day and year!\nThe password: The password should start with a lowercase letter (character class here) and be at least 8 characters long, with no upper limit. For specifying the types of characters that the password needs to contain I would use character classes. Also, for signaling that the password should contain each of these classes (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and the special symbols), I would use several positive lookahead assertions for each character class.\nCredit card expiration date: After writing the pattern for the date of birth, the one for validating the credit card expiration date should be a bit easier to conceive. Nonetheless, this is a different pattern that needs special attention. The credit card should not expire sooner than May 2024, and the date needs to follow the MM/YY format - this would be 05/24 in our case. So, split this issue in two - the rest of the year 2024 starting from May, and then any subsequent years, with no upper limit. So, you will need several OR operations - mind your pipe metacharacters, as well as some thought process on how to match the 05-12 months in 2024, and then all the other months from 2025 onwards.\n\nNote! For the rest of the tasks (not included in the Hints section) you should be able to easily find a solution given all the information we discussed throughout the course. The three tasks that I have provided hints for are indeed more complex, however they can also be solved using the concepts and syntax we discussed in the course - so you already have all the tools and knowledge to solve the entire project if you watched all the videos, took notes, wrote the code alongside me, solved the quizzes and the exercises that I provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to see the Project Source Code\n\n\n\n\n\nimport re\n\n# Asking the user for the first name and checking the format\nwhile True:\n    fname = input(\"\\nPlease enter your First Name: \")\n\n    check = re.fullmatch(r\"[A-Z][a-z]+\", fname)\n\n    if check == None:\n        print(\"Wrong format!

    "text": "Let’s break down the pandas library in simple terms with analogies.\nPandas as a Data Organizer:\nImagine you have a big box of LEGO bricks. Each LEGO brick is like a piece of data. Now, you want to build something cool with these bricks, but managing them in the box can be messy. Here’s where pandas comes in.\n\nSeries - The Single LEGO Stack:\n\nA Series is like a single stack of LEGO bricks. It’s organized and labeled. Each brick (data point) has its place, and you can easily refer to them by their position or label.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating a Series\ntemperatures = pd.Series([25, 28, 24, 30, 22], name='Temperature')\nJust like a stack of LEGO bricks neatly arranged, a Series keeps your data in order.\nDataFrame - The LEGO Structure:\n\nNow, imagine you want to build something more complex, like a spaceship. A DataFrame is like a structured LEGO creation. It consists of multiple stacks (Series), each representing a specific aspect of your project.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating a DataFrame\ndata = {'Day': ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'],\n        'Temperature': [25, 28, 24, 30, 22]}\nweather_df = pd.DataFrame(data)\nIn this analogy, your spaceship (DataFrame) has different sections (columns) for the day and temperature, and each section is like a well-organized stack of LEGO bricks (Series).\n\nLet’s look another simple example of creating dataframe:\nCertainly, Asad_Pro_Beta! Let’s break down the provided code step by step:\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1000, 'steve', 86],\n                   [1001, 'mathew', 91],\n                   [1002, 'jose', 72],\n                   [1003, 'patty', 69],\n                   [1004, 'vin', 88]],\n                  columns=['Regd.No', 'Name', 'Marks%'],\n                  index=['ID1', 'ID2', 'ID3', 'ID4', 'ID5'])\n\n# Displaying the DataFrame\nprint(df)\nExplanation:\n\nImporting Pandas:\n\nimport pandas as pd: This line imports the pandas library and gives it the alias pd. This alias is commonly used for brevity.\n\nCreating a DataFrame:\n\npd.DataFrame(...): This creates a DataFrame. The data is provided as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of data.\n\nData Values:\n\nThe inner lists contain values for ‘Regd.No’ (Registration Number), ‘Name’, and ‘Marks%’ respectively for each student.\n\nColumns:\n\ncolumns=['Regd.No', 'Name', 'Marks%']: This specifies the column names for the DataFrame.\n\nIndex:\n\nindex=['ID1', 'ID2', 'ID3', 'ID4', 'ID5']: This sets custom index values for the DataFrame. Each index corresponds to a row.\n\nDisplaying the DataFrame:\n\nprint(df): This prints the DataFrame to the console.\n\n\nResulting DataFrame:\n     Regd.No   Name  Marks%\nID1     1000  steve      86\nID2     1001  mathew     91\nID3     1002  jose       72\nID4     1003  patty      69\nID5     1004  vin        88\nSo, the DataFrame df is a table with columns ‘Regd.No’, ‘Name’, and ‘Marks%’, and custom row indices ‘ID1’ through ‘ID5’, representing information about students, their registration numbers, names, and marks percentage. Each row corresponds to a different student.\nNote: From now on i will be using Jupyter Notebook to do data analysis because Jupyter Notebook is made for that purpose. To install Jupyter Notebook go on to this Jupyter Notebook\n**Creating a DataFrame and adding some data to it.\n# Giving alias to pandas module and calling it pd instead of pandas as you would give a nickname to a person\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1000,'steve',86],\n                       [1001,'mathew',91],\n                       [1002,'jose',72],\n                       [1003,'patty',69],\n                       [1004,'vin',88]], columns = ['Regd.No','Name','Marks%'], index=['ID1','ID2','ID3','ID4','ID5'])\n\ndf\nReading the data from a webpage\nimport pandas as pd\n\nurl = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)'\n\nd = pd.read_html(url)\nd[1]\nNow we will use the above data to perform various operation on it.\nYou have to convert the DataFrame into string for regular expression to work on it.\ncontent = d[1].to_string()\ncontent[:1000]\nScenario 1: Return Data types that are mutable\ncontent = d[1].to_string()\npattern = r'\\n\\d{1,}\\s{1,}(.+?)\\s{1,}mutable.+'\n\nresult = re.findall(pattern, content)\nresult\nScenario 2: Return those data types that uses the curly braces format\npattern2 = r'\\d{1,}\\s{1,}(\\w+?)\\s{1,}.+\\{.*\\}'\nresult = re.findall(pattern2, content)\nresult\nScenario 3: Extract datatype names who is no longer than 4 characters e.g. int, set, dict, list so on.\npattern3 = r'\\n\\d{1,}\\s{1,}(\\w{3,4})\\s{1,}.+'\nresult = re.findall(pattern3, content)\nresult\nScenario 3: return the description of those id who is odd\npattern4 = r'\\n(\\d*[13579])\\s{1,}.+?\\s{1,}\\w+\\s{1,}(.{,10}).+'\nresult = re.findall(pattern4,content)\nresult\nScenario 4: return all the data type who’s syntax part contain at least one decimal part\npattern5 = r'\\n\\d{1,}\\s{1,}(\\w+).+\\s{1,}.+(\\d+\\.\\d+)'\nresult = re.findall(pattern5, content)\nresult\n\n\n\n Back to top",

A relative path which is the current working directory. e.g. .\\folder\\subfolder\n\nCreate a folder using os.makedirs() and various other essential functions\n\nimport os\n\n# Creating a directory if it exist override it with new folder\nos.makedirs('new_folder',exist_ok=True)\n\n# Removing a directory from the current directory\nos.system('rmdir hello')\n\n# Creating multiple nested level folder\nos.makedirs('.\\\\grand_parent\\\\parent\\\\child\\\\grand_child',exist_ok=True)\n\n# Getting parts of a file path\n# You can also fetch the path by using Path.cwd()\npath = Path(r'C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\delete\\delete.py')\n\n# Accesing the drive of path\nprint(path.drive)\n\n# Accesing the anchor of path\nprint(path.anchor)\n\n# Accesing the parent of path\nprint(path.parent)\n\n# Accesing the last folder name in the path\nprint(path.name)\n\n# Accessing the file extension of the file\nprint(path.suffix)\n\nFolder contents and Files sizes If you want to get the size of folder os.path provide function for that to calculate size in bytes e.g. like the following:\n\nfolders_size = 0\n\n# getting size of folder via os.path.getsize(file)\nfor filename in os.listdir(r'C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop'):\n    folders_size = folders_size + os.path.getsize(os.path.join(r'C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop',filename))\n    \n# Original file size in bytes    \nprint(folders_size)\n\n# converting the above file size to KB\nprint(folders_size/1024)\n\n# converting the above file size to MB \nprint((folders_size/1024)/1024)\n\n# converting the above file size to GB \nprint(((folders_size/1024)/1024)/1024)\n\nPath.cwd().glob('*')\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport os\n\n# Here the start * means search for all.\n\ngen = list(Path.home().glob('*'))\n\n# Find all .txt files in the current directory\ntext_files = list(Path.cwd().glob('*.txt'))\n\n# Find all .py files in the current directory and its subdirectories\npython_files = list(Path.cwd().glob('*.py'))\n\n# Find all directories in the current directory\nfolders = [entry for entry in list(Path.cwd().glob('*/')) if entry.is_dir()]\n\n\n\nprint(text_files)\nprint(python_files)\n\nfor folder in folders:\n    \n    print(folder)\n\nChecking Path Validity If python doesn’t find a valid path it will crash. Luckily both os and Path module have function for checking the validity of path whether it exists or not. Below you can see both library in action to do the same task.\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport os\n\npath = Path.home()\n\nprint('Path exists via OS: ',os.path.exists(path))\nprint('Path exists via Path: ',path.exists(), end='\\n\\n')\n\n# To check whether its a file or not\nprint('File check via OS: ',os.path.isfile(path))\nprint('File check via Path: ',path.is_file(), end='\\n\\n')\n\n# To check whether its directory or not\nprint('Directory check via OS: ',os.path.isdir(path))\nprint('Directory check via Path: ',path.is_dir())",

    "text": "The shutil Module\nThe shutil module in Python provides a higher-level interface for file operations. It offers functions for copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories in a platform-independent manner. Here are some real-life usage examples of the shutil module:\n\nCopying Files or Directories:\nimport shutil\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n\n# Copy a file\nshutil.copy('source.txt', 'destination.txt')\n\n# Copy a directory and its contents recursively\nshutil.copytree('source_directory', 'destination_directory')\n\n\nsource = Path.cwd() / 'sadiq'\ndestination = Path.cwd() / 'farooq'\n\n# In order for copytree to work properly you have to put the dirs_exist_ok paremeter to the function because it will throw an error if the destination folder already exist.\nshutil.copytree(source, destination,dirs_exist_ok=True)\nMoving or Renaming Files or Directories:\n# Move a file or directory\nshutil.move('source.txt', 'destination.txt')\n\n# Rename a file or directory\nshutil.move('old_name.txt', 'new_name.txt')\nDeleting Files or Directories:\n# Delete a single file\nos.remove('file_to_delete.txt')\n\n# Delete an empty directory\nos.rmdir('empty_directory')\n\n# Delete a directory and its contents recursively\nshutil.rmtree('directory_to_delete')\n\n# remove all the text file in the current directory\nfor file in Path.glob(Path.cwd(),'*.txt'):\n\n   # for directory use rmdir instead of unlink\n   file.unlink(missing_ok=True)\nArchiving and Extracting Files:\n# Create a zip archive of a directory\nshutil.make_archive('archive', 'zip', 'directory_to_archive')\n\n# Extract the contents of a zip archive\nshutil.unpack_archive('archive.zip', 'extracted_directory')\nCopying or Moving Files Based on File Metadata:\n# Copy files based on their extension\nfor filename in os.listdir('source_directory'):\n    if filename.endswith('.txt'):\n        shutil.copy(os.path.join('source_directory', filename), 'text_files_directory')\n\nThese are just a few examples of how you can use the shutil module to perform common file operations efficiently and reliably.",
