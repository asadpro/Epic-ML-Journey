Install python from the following link or watch any youtube video on it to install it as it requires only vscode (editor) and python language installation:
Certainly, Asad_Pro_3.1. Here’s a paraphrased version of the instructions:

1. Visit [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), download the Notepad++ text editor, and install it without requiring administrator privileges.
2. Ensure easy access to Notepad++ by placing shortcuts on your desktop and/or in Quick Launch during the installation.
3. Launch PowerShell from the Start menu by searching for it and pressing Enter.
4. Create shortcuts for PowerShell on your desktop and/or Quick Launch for convenience.
5. Open your Terminal program, and if Python is not recognized, install it from Python.
6. Consider using ActiveState Python if administrative rights are an issue. If Python isn’t recognized after installation, set the environment variable in PowerShell and restart it.

> a. If you run python and it’s not there (python is not recognized.), install it from http://python.org/download.
> b. Make sure you install Python 2, not Python 3.
> c. You may be better off with ActiveState Python, especially if you do not have administrative rights.
> d. If after you install it python still isn’t recognized, then in PowerShell enter this: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(“Path”, “$env:Path;C:”, “User”)`
> e. Close PowerShell and then start it again to make sure Python now runs. If it doesn’t, restart may be required.

7. Type `quit()` in Python to exit.
8. Return to the previous prompt in the Terminal and troubleshoot if necessary.
9. Learn how to create a directory in the Terminal.
10. Familiarize yourself with changing directories in the Terminal.
11. Utilize your text editor to create a file in the directory, then save it.
12. Switch back to the Terminal using keyboard shortcuts.
13. In the Terminal, check if you can list the directory to confirm the creation of your new file.
